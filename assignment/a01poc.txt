Loan Approval System

In a financial institution,
 a Loan Approval System is responsible for evaluating loan applications from customers and deciding whether to approve or reject a loan request based on certain criteria. 

You are tasked with implementing a program that automates the loan approval process. The system should evaluate loan requests for various types of loans (e.g., Personal Loan, Home Loan, Car Loan) based on the following factors:

1. Customer Information:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Annual Income
   - Credit Score

2. Loan Request Information:
   - Loan Type (Personal, Home, Car)
   - Loan Amount Requested
   - Loan Term (in years)
   
3. Approval Criteria:
   - For Personal Loan:
     - The applicant's age should be between 21 and 60.
     - The credit score must be 650 or higher.
     - The requested loan amount should not exceed 50% of the applicant’s annual income.
   - For Home Loan:
     - The applicant's age should be between 25 and 55.
     - The credit score must be 700 or higher.
     - The requested loan amount should not exceed 60% of the applicant’s annual income.
   - For Car Loan:
     - The applicant's age should be between 23 and 60.
     - The credit score must be 600 or higher.
     - The requested loan amount should not exceed 40% of the applicant’s annual income.

4. Loan Term Validation:
   - The loan term should be between 1 and 20 years for all loan types.

5. Output:
   - If the application meets all the approval criteria, the system should approve the loan and display the loan details.
   - If the application fails any of the approval criteria, the system should reject the loan and provide a rejection reason.

Sample Input:
java
Customer Details:
- Name: X
- Age: 30
- Annual Income: 60000
- Credit Score: 720

Loan Request Details:
- Loan Type: Home Loan
- Loan Amount Requested: 35000
- Loan Term: 15 years


Sample Output:

Loan Application Status: Approved
Loan Details:
- Loan Type: Home Loan
- Loan Amount: 35000
- Loan Term: 15 years
- Monthly Payment: Rs 250.12 (calculated using interest rate for home loan)


 Additional  Features (Optional):
1. Interest Calculation: Implement simple interest or compound interest calculation for the loan repayments.
2. Loan Repayment Schedule: Display a repayment schedule for the approved loans, showing the amount to be paid each month over the loan term.
3. Loan Rejection Reasons: Provide detailed rejection reasons based on the specific criteria that were violated.

Steps to Implement:
1. Create `Customer` and `LoanRequest` classes.
2. Implement loan validation logic in a `LoanApprovalSystem` class.
3. Use conditional checks to evaluate loan requests against the approval criteria.
4. Implement interest calculation and loan repayment schedule logic.
