Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Here are the core concepts in Kubernetes:

1. Cluster: A cluster is a set of node machines for running containerized applications. It is the foundation of Kubernetes and consists of at least one master node and several worker nodes.

2. Node: A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, previously known as a minion. A node may be a VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node contains the services necessary to run pods and is managed by the master components.

3. Pod: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers. Pods are ephemeral and can be created, destroyed, and recreated as needed.

4. Service: A service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. This set of pods is typically determined by a selector. Services enable a loose coupling between dependent pods.

5. Volume: A volume in Kubernetes is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the containers in a pod. Kubernetes volumes have an explicit lifetime - the same as the pod that encloses them.

6. Namespace: Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. They provide a scope for names and can be used to divide resources between different teams or projects.

7. Deployment: A deployment provides declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

8. ReplicaSet: A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

9. StatefulSet: A StatefulSet is a workload API object used to manage stateful applications. It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

10. ConfigMap and Secret: ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys.

11. Ingress: An Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

12. Label and Selector: Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users. Selectors allow users to filter a list of resources based on labels.

13. Kubelet: The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a pod.

14. Kubectl: Kubectl is a command-line tool used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

1. Loan Application Frontend: A web application where users submit loan requests.
2. Loan Approval Backend: A service that processes loan requests and approves or rejects them.
3. Database: A PostgreSQL database to store loan applications and user data.
4. Credit Score Service: A microservice that fetches credit scores for users from an external API.

This is way , we can deploy this system using Kubernetes:

---

 1. Define the Database (PostgreSQL) as a StatefulSet
Since the database is stateful, we use a StatefulSet to ensure stable network identities and persistent storage.

yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: postgres-db
spec:
  serviceName: "postgres"
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:13
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          value: "securepassword"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
        volumeMounts:
        - name: postgres-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: postgres-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi


---

 2. Create a Service for the Database
A Service exposes the database to other components in the cluster.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  selector:
    app: postgres
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    targetPort: 5432


---

 3. Deploy the Credit Score Service
The credit score service is stateless, so we use a Deployment.

yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: credit-score-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: credit-score
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: credit-score
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: credit-score
        image: credit-score-service:1.0
        env:
        - name: API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credit-score-secret
              key: api-key
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080


---

 4. Create a Service for the Credit Score Service
This allows the loan approval backend to communicate with the credit score service.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: credit-score-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: credit-score
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080


---

 5. Deploy the Loan Approval Backend
The backend is also stateless, so we use a Deployment.

yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: loan-approval-backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: loan-approval
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: loan-approval
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: loan-approval
        image: loan-approval-backend:1.0
        env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: "postgres"
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: postgres-secret
              key: password
        - name: CREDIT_SCORE_SERVICE_URL
          value: "http://credit-score-service:8080"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000


---

 6. Create a Service for the Loan Approval Backend
This exposes the backend to the frontend.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: loan-approval-backend
spec:
  selector:
    app: loan-approval
  ports:
  - port: 5000
    targetPort: 5000


---

 7. Deploy the Loan Application Frontend
The frontend is stateless and serves the user interface.

yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: loan-application-frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: loan-frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: loan-frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: loan-frontend
        image: loan-application-frontend:1.0
        env:
        - name: BACKEND_URL
          value: "http://loan-approval-backend:5000"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


---

 8. Expose the Frontend to the Internet
We use an Ingress to expose the frontend to external users.

yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: loan-application-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: loans.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: loan-application-frontend
            port:
              number: 80


---

 9. Secrets for Sensitive Data
Store sensitive data like database passwords and API keys in Secrets.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: postgres-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: c2VjdXJlcGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64 encoded "securepassword"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: credit-score-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  api-key: Y3JlZGl0c2NvcmVhcGlrZXk=  # base64 encoded "creditscoreapikey"


---

 10. Scaling and Monitoring
- Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the frontend and backend based on CPU or memory usage.
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the cluster and application performance.

---

 Summary
In this example:
- StatefulSet is used for the database to ensure persistence.
- Deployments are used for stateless services like the frontend, backend, and credit score service.
- Services enable communication between components.
- Ingress exposes the frontend to external users.
- Secrets securely store sensitive data.

This setup ensures the loan approval system is scalable, resilient, and secure, leveraging Kubernetes' core concepts effectively.
