 CI/CD for a Loan Application Built in Spring Boot using AWS

In the context of a loan application built with Spring Boot and deployed on AWS, CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your application every time changes are made to the codebase.

steps and tools used in a typical CI/CD pipeline. We'll use GitHub for version control, GitHub Actions or Jenkins for CI/CD, AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment, and Amazon RDS for database management.


1. Source Code Management: GitHub

First, you have your Spring Boot loan application code stored in a GitHub repository.

 2. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

The purpose of CI is to automatically build and test your application whenever changes are made to the codebase. This helps catch issues early in the development process.

Tools for CI:
 GitHub Actions (for automated workflows)
 Maven or Gradle (for building the Spring Boot application)
 JUnit (for unit tests)

Steps in the CI Pipeline:

1. Code Push:
   Every time a developer pushes new code to GitHub (e.g., fixing a bug or adding a feature), the CI pipeline is triggered.

2. CI Workflow (GitHub Actions):
   Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to define the CI pipeline.

Example `ci.yml` (GitHub Actions):

yaml
name: Spring Boot CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
       main  Trigger the workflow on push to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
       main  Trigger the workflow on pull requests to 'main'

jobs:
  build:
    runson: ubuntulatest

    steps:
     name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2  Get the code from the GitHub repository

     name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setupjava@v2
      with:
        javaversion: '11'  Set the Java version to 11

     name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean install DskipTests=true  Build the app (without tests for speed)

     name: Run tests
      run: mvn test  Run unit tests using Maven

     name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build t loanapp .
      
     name: Push Docker image to AWS ECR (Optional)
      run: |
        Login to AWS ECR and push the docker image (use your ECR repository URL)
        aws ecr getloginpassword region useast1 | docker login username AWS passwordstdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.useast1.amazonaws.com
        docker tag loanapp:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.useast1.amazonaws.com/loanapp:latest
        docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.useast1.amazonaws.com/loanapp:latest


Explanation:
 Checkout: Pull the code from GitHub.
 Set up Java: Use JDK 11 for building the Spring Boot application.
 Build with Maven: Run `mvn clean install` to compile and package the application.
 Run tests: Execute unit tests with `mvn test`.
 Build Docker image (Optional): Build a Docker image of the application for deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS.
 Push Docker image to AWS ECR (Optional): If you're using Docker, push the image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).



 3. Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline

The goal of CD is to automatically deploy the application to your staging or production environment on AWS, after the CI pipeline has passed successfully.

Tools for CD:
 AWS Elastic Beanstalk (for easy application deployment)
 AWS CodeDeploy (for deployment automation)
 AWS RDS (for database)

Steps in the CD Pipeline:

1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk Setup:
    Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment (e.g., "loanappprod") to host the application.
    Ensure that your Spring Boot application is packaged as a `.jar` or `.war` file.

2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment (CD):
   When the code passes the CI pipeline, the CD pipeline deploys the application to Elastic Beanstalk.

Example of a GitHub Actions Workflow for CD:

yaml
name: Spring Boot CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
       main  Trigger deployment when changes are pushed to the 'main' branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runson: ubuntulatest

    steps:
     name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

     name: Set up AWS CLI
      run: |
        curl "https://d1vvhvl2y92vvt.cloudfront.net/awscliexelinuxx86_64.zip" o "awscliv2.zip"
        unzip awscliv2.zip
        sudo ./aws/install

     name: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy
      run: |
        AWS credentials stored in GitHub secrets for security
        aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws configure set default.region useast1
        
        Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
        eb init p java region useast1 loanapp
        eb use loanappprod
        eb deploy  Deploy the new version to Elastic Beanstalk


Explanation:
 AWS CLI Setup: Install AWS CLI to interact with AWS services.
 AWS Configuration: Use GitHub secrets to securely store AWS credentials.
 Elastic Beanstalk Deployment: Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI (`eb`) to deploy the app to the environment (`loanappprod`).



 4. Database Management (Amazon RDS)

In your loan application, you likely have a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store loan details, user information, etc. For managing the database, weâ€™ll use Amazon RDS.

Steps for Database Setup:
1. Create an RDS Instance:
    Launch an Amazon RDS instance to store your database.
    Configure it with the correct instance type, storage, and security groups.
    Set up your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to interact with your Spring Boot application.

2. Database Migration:
    Use Flyway or Liquibase in your Spring Boot application to manage database migrations (create tables, add columns, etc.).
    Each time a change is pushed to the `main` branch, Flyway or Liquibase will automatically run the necessary database migrations during the deployment process.



 5. Pipeline Monitoring & Notifications

You should also set up notifications for the pipeline's success or failure. This can be done using:
 Slack notifications (via GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).
 Email notifications for build and deploy status.



 Summary of the CI/CD Process for the Loan Application:

1. CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions):
    Triggered on code changes pushed to GitHub.
    Builds the Spring Boot application using Maven or Gradle.
    Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
    Optionally builds and pushes Docker images to AWS ECR.
   
2. CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):
    Triggered after the successful completion of the CI pipeline.
    Deploys the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    Elastic Beanstalk automatically manages scaling and high availability.

3. Database Management:
    Amazon RDS handles the database for your application.
    Flyway or Liquibase automatically manages schema migrations during deployments.

4. Monitoring:
    Notifications and monitoring are set up for visibility into pipeline status.
